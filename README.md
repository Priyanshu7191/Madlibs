The Mad Libs Generator is a fun and interactive word game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users fill in blanks with different types of words (like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), and the app uses those words to generate a funny and personalized story.

It's a great beginner project to practice working with forms, DOM manipulation, and basic JavaScript logic!
